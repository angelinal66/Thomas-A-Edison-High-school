                <p class="li">The Parent-Teacher Association of Thomas Edison was established to promote the school's educational excellence and welfare. Since then, it has served as a conduit to highlight parental concerns to the administration. In addition, the association works closely with the Principal and acts as a communications system between parents and the school to exchange views in both curricular and non-curricular areas. 
 
Please visit this page often to read about all the great things we have planned, give us feedback, and share your opinions. Thank you for your continued support!

                <p class="li"> About the PTA
The Thomas A. Edison High School Parent Teacher Association is a volunteer organization joining both parents and teachers in a shared venture: enhancing education to enrich our children's lives and learning experiences.
 
This goal is accomplished in various ways, including sponsoring specific programs for students and parents, sharing parenting support, providing information to parents about the school and activities, and creating opportunities for administration, teachers, parents, and students to collaborate. All student's families are automatically members of the PTA, although your voluntary contribution would help support our activities. We encourage your active participation and support, as we look forward to seeing you at our meetings and events. The PTA is organized and constituted in accordance with the NYC Chancellor's Regulations A-660. </p>
